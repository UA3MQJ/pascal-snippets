# Pascal Snippets Package for Sublime Text 3

This package based on [this package]( https://github.com/fnkr/ST-Pascal).
Unfortunately, the other has not updated for a long time.
I hope this package will help people in studing Pascal lang.

# Easy installation

You can install this awesome package through the Package Control.

Press `⌘/Ctrl + ⇧ + P` to open the command palette.
Type Package Control: Install Package and press enter. Then search for `Pascal Support`.
